# **MCQ Automated Grading System**  
🚀 *Final Year Project (In Progress)*  

## **📌 About This Project**  
This project is part of my final year research work. It aims to automate the grading of multiple-choice question (MCQ) answer sheets using **OpenCV** and **image processing techniques**. The system will detect and evaluate answer markings, compare them with a predefined answer key, and calculate scores automatically.  

## **⚠️ Work in Progress**  
This project is still under development. Some core features are yet to be implemented or refined. Updates will be pushed regularly as progress is made.  

## **💡 Goals**  
- ✅ Detect and extract answer sections from scanned or photographed MCQ sheets  
- ✅ Identify the selected answers using contour detection and intensity analysis  
- ⏳ Compare detected answers with the correct answer key and generate scores *(In Progress)*  
- ⏳ Optimize accuracy and robustness for different image conditions *(Upcoming)*  

## **📜 Notes**  
- This is a **work-in-progress final year project**  
- The repository will be updated frequently with **code improvements, new features, and documentation**  
- Contributions, feedback, or suggestions are welcome
